This is a binary ICO file that would be generated from the SVG. Since I cannot create binary files directly, you'll need to convert the SVG favicon to ICO format using an online converter or tool like:
1. https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
3. Or use ImageMagick: convert favicon.svg favicon.ico

The ICO file should be 32x32 pixels with the same medical heart and cross design as the SVG.
